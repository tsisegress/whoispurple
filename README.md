# Hi 👋

I’m a human.  
Not a framework. Not a library. Just carbon-based.

I’m **trying** to be a developer.  
Some days I write code.  
Some days the code writes bugs.  
Most days we coexist peacefully.

## What I do here
- Break things  
- Fix one thing, create three new problems  (I’m improving, relax)

## Tech situation
- I don’t “know everything”
- I do know how to debug at 2 AM
- StackOverflow is my mentor
- Docs are read *after* things fail

## Current status
- Learning by doing  
- Doing by failing  
- Failing forward (hopefully)

If you’re here to judge my code — fair.  
If you’re here to learn with me — welcome.  
If you’re here accidentally — same.

Still human.  
Still trying to be a dev.  
Progress > perfection.
